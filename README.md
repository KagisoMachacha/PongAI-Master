# PongAI Master

PongAI Master is an AI program developed using Python and the Pygame library that showcases an advanced AI agent playing the classic game of Pong. The project leverages the power of neural networks, specifically the NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) algorithm, to train the AI agent and enable it to compete against human players or other AI opponents in Pong.

## Key Features

- **Intelligent Gameplay:** PongAI Master utilizes a neural network to learn and adapt to different game situations, exhibiting strategic decision-making and precise ball control.
- **Real-time Training:** The AI agent undergoes a training process, using the NEAT algorithm, to improve its performance over time. It learns from its successes and failures, evolving its neural network architecture dynamically.
- **Adjustable Difficulty:** PongAI Master allows users to customize the difficulty level, enabling beginners and experienced players to find the right challenge.
- **Interactive Interface:** The Pygame library provides an engaging graphical interface for users to interact with the AI agent, observe its gameplay, and enjoy the nostalgic Pong experience.

## Technologies

- **Python:** The primary programming language used to build the AI agent and game mechanics.
- **Pygame:** The library utilized for creating the Pong game environment, handling graphics, and user input.
- **NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies):** The algorithm employed to train and evolve the AI agent's neural network.
